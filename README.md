# ECE387-Lab7
Lab - Mobile App
Build a mobile app on either an IOS or Android.  
This app should show a button and then do something when it is pressed (very simple but needs to be your code).

# Instructions for the lab：
In this lab, we step away from the microcontroller and make sure that you are aware that smartphones can be programmed too.
